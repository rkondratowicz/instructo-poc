    "Present users with a numbered list of matching resources, including clickable full URLs (constructed as https://github.com/rkondratowicz/instructo-poc/blob/main/{path}) and brief explanations of why they might meet their needs",
    "After presenting the list, ask the user to specify the numbers of the prompts they want to apply to their project",
    "Once the user selects the desired resources, download only the markdown files (not metadata) from the GitHub repository and place them in the appropriate directory within the user's project (.github/instructions for instructions, .github/prompts for prompts), creating the directories if they do not already exist"
